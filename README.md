Hey, I'm @aidenjanzen! \
Welcome to my GitHub!

I use this to post projects I work on in class or at home. \
I enjoy backend coding for webpages using Flask and combining them with HTML and CSS to make fun interactive websites. \
I have plenty of experience working with computers even building my own at age 11. \
Fiddling around with computers comes naturally to me, especially when there is a problem, I cant set it down until it's fixed.


I am currently studying Computer Information Technology at BCIT. \
You can reach me through my school email ajanzen16@my.bcit.ca
